## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid (with grid-template-areas)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fluid typography with clamp()
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Static site framework

### What I learned

This was my first Frontend Mentor challenge using Astro. After seeing someone else's solution built with Astro, I got curious and completed the official tutorial before tackling this project.

Key Astro learnings:
- Using Astro's `Image` component for automatic image optimization
- Structuring component-based layouts with scoped styles
- Working with `.astro` files and component imports
- Deploying an Astro project to Netlify

The component structure made organizing the bento grid cards very clean, with each card being self-contained with its own styles and logic.
